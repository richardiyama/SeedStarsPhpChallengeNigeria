                        <p>Jenkins (http://jenkins-ci.org/) is a open source continuous integration server.</p>

                        <p>
                            Create a script, in PHP, that uses Jenkins' API to get a list of jobs and their status from a given jenkins instance. The status for each job should be stored in an sqlite database along with the time for when it was checked.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Make an application which stores names and email addresses in a database (SQLite is fine). 
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>a) Has welcome page in http://localhost/ 
                                <ul>
                                    <li>- this page has links to list and create functions</li></li>
                        </ul> 
                        <li>b) Lists all stored names / email address in http://localhost/list</li>
                        <li>c) Adds a name / email address to the database in http://localhost/add
                            <ul>
                                <li>  - should validate input and show errors</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            Since youâ€™re doing an application in make sure the app does not have major security problems: CSRF, XSS, SQL Injection.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Make reasonable assumptions, state your assumptions, and proceed. Once you 
                            have completed the challenge let us know and share your thoughts on the 
                            problems/solutions.
