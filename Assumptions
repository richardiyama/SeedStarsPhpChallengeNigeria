The following are my assumptions


- I used laravel framwork because its makes development faster and easy
-This framwork also makes it easy to protect application from cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.

- In terms of SQL Injection,Laravel’s Eloquent ORM uses PDO parameter binding to avoid SQL injection security risk.
- Laravel protects web applications from cross-site scripting which is also a security risk.
Promblems
- I had problem with the Console Script.I was geting the following error: Notice: Trying to get property of non-object in C:\Documents\SeedstarsPhpChallenge\Phpscript\JobScript.php on line 29 From the Command Prompt.I will still try to figure out the error and fix it.
